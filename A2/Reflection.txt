Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to the
previous assignment? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

2. Why did the dance method have to have a parameter (the CartoonCharacter face
parameter)?

3. When using several "if" statements, you can use a sequence of separate "if"
statements or you can combine them into a longer "if... else if .... else if ...."
statement. What's the difference? Is one better than the other?
